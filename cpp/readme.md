# Basic Algorithms in C++

This project contains basic algorithms in c++, there are available code in JavaScript and Python in root folder of this project. This project is made for educational purposes only and can be a good guide who wants to get their feet wet in algorithm analysis and c++ coding with STL.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
* Install cpp compiler with atleast std=c++11 support
* Compile the code usign: g++ -std=c++11 driver.cpp utility.cpp sort.cpp -o Algo
* Run the compiled program by typing Algo (or the name you used while compiling)
* If everything is installed correctly you will see basic c++ sorted vector in the output.
